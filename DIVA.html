			<h3>Problem</h3>
			<p>
			Multiple drugs taken together can cause adverse drug reactions due to drug-drug interactions (DDIs). These adverse reactions cost <strong> 100,000 deaths</strong>
			and <strong>$170 billion</strong> annually in the U.S. alone.
			Currently, at the FDA, drug safety evaluators detect adverse reaction signals  by analyzing large number of 
			<a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/surveillance/postmarketing-surveillance-programs"> adverse event reports</a>. 
			<br> <br>
			
			Machine learning applied to these reports generate even a larger number of DDI signals that are <strong>difficult to interpret</strong> and are <strong>hypotheses</strong> about potential signals that need human validation. 
				<br> <br>
			</p>
			<p class="mediumSizeFont">
				<strong>My goal </strong>is to design an interactive visualization tool <strong>(DIVA)</strong> that aligns with the drug safety review workflow to support the analysis of
				these hypothesized drug-drug interaction (DDI) signals.

				<h3 >User Research</h3>
				<p><strong>Target Users </strong></p>
				<p> Our users for DIVA are drug safety evaluators at the Division of Pharmacovigilance at the FDA who are responsible for the detection adverse drug reactions (signals).</p>
				
				<p><strong>Key Research Questions and Areas </strong>
					<ul>	
						<li>How drug safety reports are analyzed?</li>
						<li>What are the key challenges users currently face?</li>
						<li>Observe and understand users' current review process. </li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p><strong>Methodology </strong> </p>
				<p>The user research took a total of two weeks and included the following activities with five users. 
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Week 1 (Phase 1).</strong> 45 minutes remote interviews to get an overview of their workflow. </li>
							<li><strong>Week 2 (Phase 2a).</strong> 30 minutes contextual inquiry to observe users at work. </li>	
							<li><strong>Week 2 (Phase 2b).</strong> 30 minutes in person interviews for follow-up discussion and clarification.</li>
						</ul>

			   <h3>User Workflow for Signal Detection</h3>
			   Based on our interviews in Phase 1, the drug safety review workflow is summarized below.

				<h3>Affinity Diagram to Categorize Users' Needs</h3>

			<h3>Key Findings from User Research</h3>
			<p> Based on the user research, the following features were identified as high priority for the visual analytics to help in the analysis of the DDI signals.  
				<ul>
					<li>Provide an overview of all DDI signals.</li>
					<li>Allow analysts to segment and prioritize signals.</li>	
					<li>Integrate information about previously known (discovered) signals.</li>
					<li>Facilitate identification of unknown (undiscovered) signals.</li>
					<li>Facilitate identification of severe adverse reactions. </li>
					<li>Access to raw reports supporting the signals.</li>
				</ul>

		<div id="Design" class="topMargin">
				<h3 >Design Process </h3>
				<p><strong>DDI Signals Data to be Visualized </strong></p>
				<p>Based on our user research, we integrated domain knowledge into an already complex DDI signal generated by machine learning. The final data model to be visualized consists of the following elements.
					<ul>
						<li>The two interacting drugs (DDI).</li>
						<li>A set of adverse reactions associated with the DDI.</li>
						<li>A numeric score (machine learning metric) that represents the significance of the signal. </li>
						<li>Domain knowledge about the signal status being known or known.</li>
						<li>Domain knowledge about the signal having a severe reaction (DME).</li>
					</ul> 
				</p>
				
				<p><strong>Literature Review </strong> </p>
				<p>
				To start, we reviewed academic research papers and other published best practices for designing visualizations for machine-learning output and drug related information. 
				In addition to the required features, we learned some best practices and guidelines for designing multiple coordinated views - such as details on demand, selecting chart types based on the data and task, and direct manipulation of data.
				</p>
		</div>
		<div class="topMargin">		
				<h3>Visual Design and Prototypes to Get User Feedback</h3>
				
				<p>Given the complexity of the DDI signals and user tasks, designing a single visualization is not feasible. Based on literature review and heuristic analysis of different visualization techniques for the underlying data, we considered various visualizations. 
				<br> <br>

				<img class="figBotMargin" src="projects/DIVAsketch.jpg" alt="Preliminary Sketches"/> <br><br> 


				To help users explore the set of all the machine-generated drug-drug interactions (DDIs) the first suitable candidate is an Adjacency Matrix (below figures). Due to sparsity of the matrix for real data, alternatively, a node-link diagram is designed.
				</p>
		
				<img class="figBotMargin" src="projects/divamatrix.png" alt="Adjacency Matrix"/> <br><br>

				<p>
				In the node-link diagrams (following figure), the nodes are mapped to the drugs and the links depict the interaction between drugs. The visual encodings, i.e., color and size of 
				the links (Screening view) and nodes (Triage view) are mapped to the significance score of the signals and status of the reactions, respectively.
				
				
				<br><br><img class="figBotMargin" src="projects/divanl.png" alt="Node-Link Diagrams"/>
				
				The node-link design for all the views are iteratively refined to choose the most suitable visual encodings
				for mapping the underlying signals data. 
				</p>
		</div>

				<h3> Final Visual Design </h3>
				  
				<p>DIVA (shown below) consists of three coordinated views to help with the drug safety tasks. <br><br>
		
				<strong>The Screening View (Left)</strong> gives an overview of all hypothesized DDI signals supporting a user in screening unknown and
				high scored signals. Each node is a drug and link represents an interaction between the drugs. 
				<br><br>
				
				<strong>The Triage View (Middle) </strong> displays all the drug interactions associated with a particular
						drug (depicted as middle blue node). It helps users prioritize a drug for review based on its intearctions.
				<br><br>		
				<strong> The Forensics View (Right) </strong> uses a tree diagram that includes adverse reactions (third layer of nodes) related to each
						drug-drug interaction for further exploration. The purple color is used to highlight severe reactions.
				</p>

				<figcaption class="alignCenterCaption">DIVA Interface. <strong>Left: </strong>Screening view to explore the DDI signals. <strong>Middle: </strong> Triage view to prioritize signals related to specific drugs.
					<strong>Right: </strong>Forensics view to get the adverse reaction details of a drug related signals.

		</div>

		<div id="CaseStudy" class="topMargin">
				<h3 >Validation - DIVA Helps in Quick Detection and Validation of Signals</h3>
				For evaluation, case studies followed by brief interviews were conducted with ten users at the FDA. <br><br>
				<p><strong>Case Study</strong></p>
				<p>
					This case study demonstrates the effectiveness of DIVA in interpretting and identifying interesting DDI signals generated by machine learning that need validation. <br><br>
					During exploration of DIVA, the user identifies Lansoprazole with a high scored (dark color) unknown interaction with Digoxin in the Screening view. The user investigates this DDI further in the Forensics view 
				    and notices a serious reaction (Acute Kidney Injury). 
					
					<br> <br> Upon reviewing the reports, the user discovers that other drugs taken by the patient in these reports might be the underlying
					reason for this severe reaction.</p>

				<p><strong>Positive Feedback from Users</strong></p>
				<blockquote class="centerQuote"> "It is easy to differentiate DMEs from non-DMEs through the highlights, as compared
						to reading the list or trusting one's memory."</blockquote>
				<blockquote class="centerQuote">"Having the ability to
						highlight interesting and highly scored signals is very effective in
						narrowing down our investigation."</blockquote>
				<blockquote class="centerQuote">"This has not been
						done before, it is very useful and aligns with our workflow."</blockquote>
