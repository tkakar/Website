		<div id="Goal">
				<h3 >Drug-drug Interactions - Huge Healthcare Problem</h3>
				<p>
				The expanded use of multiple drugs has increased the occurrence of adverse drug reactions induced by drug-drug interactions (DDIs). In the U.S., adverse reactions cost <strong> 100,000 deaths</strong>
				and <strong>$170 billion</strong> annually.
				</p> 
				<!-- <br> -->

						<figcaption class="alignCenterCaption"> DDI Example - Warfarin and Ibuprofen, if taken together, can lead to severe bleeding</figcaption>
				</figure> <br>

				<h3>Challenge</h3>
				<p>
				Currently, adverse reaction signals are detected through a tedious manual process in which drug safety evaluators review a large number of reports collected through
				<a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/surveillance/postmarketing-surveillance-programs"> post-marketing drug surveillance programs</a>. 
				<br> <br>
				Recently developed machine learning techniques for these reports generate even a larger number of hypothesized DDI signals that are difficult to interpret, are disconnected
				from the underlying reports important for providing context, and require human judgement to be validated
				in the domain context as a true signal warranting action.  <br> <br>
				
				<!-- <h2  class="alignCenterCaption">Project Goal</h2>
				<p class="alignCenterCaption"> -->
				<strong>The goal of this project </strong>is to design an interactive visual analytics system <strong>(DIVA)</strong> that aligns with the drug safety analysis workflow to support the screening and verification of
				hypothesized drug-drug interaction signals. 
				</p> 
				<!-- <br> -->
				<!-- Due to the human involvement to verify these hypotheses, a visual analytics system is designed for effective decision making.

				<h3>Team</h3>
				<p> 
					I led all the research, design, and development activities of this project and collaborated with FDA stakeholders, domain experts, researchers, and data scientists.

		<div id="TaskAnalysis">
				<h3 >User Research</h3>
				<p><strong>Target Users </strong></p>
				<p> Our users for DIVA are drug safety evaluators at the Division of Pharmacovigilance (DPV) at the FDA who are responsible for the detection of drug safety signals, that is, adverse reactions.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Key Research Questions and Areas </strong>
					<ul>	
						<li>How drug safety reports are analyzed?</li>
						<li>What are the key challenges users currently face?</li>
						<li>Observe and understand users' current review process. </li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p><strong>Methodology </strong> </p>
						<!-- I conducted semi-structured interviews and observed five users at the FDA to understand their drug safety review workflow and challenges. These interviews were guided by the following questions. </p> -->
						
				<p>The user research took a total of two weeks and included the following activities with five users. 
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Week 1 (Phase 1).</strong> 45 minutes remote interviews to get an overview of their workflow. </li>
							<li><strong>Week 2 (Phase 2a).</strong> 30 minutes contextual inquiry to observe users at work. </li>	
							<li><strong>Week 2 (Phase 2b ).</strong> 30 minutes in person interviews for follow-up discussion and clarification.</li>
						</ul>
				</p>

				<!-- <p><strong>Interview Questions </strong> </p>
					<p><ul>
							<li>How and when their analysis starts?</li>
							<li>What kind of reports do they analyze?</li>	
							<li>What steps do they take to analyze these reports?</li>
							<li>What triggers a particular analysis step?</li>
							<li>How do they screen reports? What constitutes a red flag? </li>
					</ul>
				</p> -->

			   <h3>User Workflow</h3>
			   Based on our interviews in Phase 1, the drug safety review workflow is summarized below.

				<blockquote class="centerQuote"> "I first look for reports with a serious outcome such as death or hospitalization."</blockquote>
				<blockquote class="centerQuote">"If it is a designated medical event (DME) or rare reaction, I will open that report."</blockquote>
				<blockquote class="centerQuote">"We review direct reports as a priority, as we are the first ones to look at them."</blockquote>

				<h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
				<p>Based on the user research, an affinity diagram was created to identify and group users' needs and concerns.</p>

		<h3>Design Requirements</h3>
		<p> Based on the user research, the following features were identified as high priority for the visual analytics to help in the analysis of the hypothesized DDI signals.  
			<ul>
				<li>Provide an overview of all hypothesized signals.</li>
				<li>Allow analysts to segment and prioritize signals.</li>	
				<li>Integrate information about previously known (discovered) signals.</li>
				<li>Facilitate identification of unknown (undiscovered) signals.</li>
				<li>Facilitate identification of severe adverse reactions. </li>
				<li>Ready access to evidence (reports) supporting signals.</li>
			</ul>
		</p> <br>

		<div id="Design">
				<h3 >Design Process </h3>
				<p><strong>Hypothesized Signals Data </strong></p>
				<p>Based on our user research, we integrated domain knowledge into an already complex DDI signal generated by machine learning. The final data model to be visualized consists of the following elements.
					<ul>
						<li>The two interacting drugs (DDI).</li>
						<li>A set of adverse reactions associated with the DDI.</li>
						<li>A numeric score (machine learning metric) that represents the significance of the signal. </li>
						<li>Domain knowledge about the signal status being known or known.</li>
						<li>Domain knowledge about the signal having a severe reaction (DME).</li>
					</ul> 
				</p>
				<p><strong>Supported Tasks </strong></p>
				
				<p>Based on our user research, the system should support users in the exploration of these hypothesized signals,
					 where they can interactively screen and prioritize important signals i.e., highly scored and unknown signals, and analyze them to see if further investigation is needed. </p>
				
				<p><strong>Literature Review </strong> </p>
				<p>
				To start, we reviewed academic research papers and other published best practices for designing visualizations for machine-learning output and drug related information. 
				In addition to the required features, we learned some best practices and guidelines for designing multiple coordinated views - such as 'details on demand, 'selecting chart types based on the data and task', and 'direct manipulation of data'.
				</p>



				<p><strong>Visual Design and Prototypes</strong></p>
				
				<p>Given the complexity of the DDI signals and user tasks, designing a single visualization is not feasible. Based on literature review and heuristic analysis of different visualization techniques for the underlying data, we considered various visualizations. 
				<br> <br>

				<img src="projects/DIVAsketch.jpg" alt="Preliminary Sketches"/> <br><br> 


				To help users explore the set of all the machine-generated drug-drug interactions (DDIs) the first suitable candidate is an Adjacency Matrix (below figures). Due to sparsity of the matrix for real data, alternatively, a node-link diagram is designed.
				</p>
		
				<img src="projects/divamatrix.png" alt="Adjacency Matrix"/> <br><br>

				<p>
				<!-- <br><br> -->
				In the node-link diagrams (following figure), the nodes are mapped to the drugs and the links depict the interaction between drugs. The visual encodings, i.e., color and size of 
				the links (Screening view) and nodes (Triage view) are mapped to the significance score of the signals and status of the reactions, respectively.
				
				
				<br><br><img src="projects/divanl.png" alt="Node-Link Diagrams"/> <br><br>
				
				The node-link design for all the views are iteratively refined to choose the most suitable visual encodings
				for mapping the underlying signals data. 
				<!-- To help analaysts prioritize drugs based on their signals, a node-link diagram based small-multiples layout (Signal Triage View) is designed to show the DDIs associated with a single drug. 
				Finally, to support the analysis of DDIs in detail by displaying their associated adverse reactions, a tree diagram (Signal Forensics View) is designed following similar visual encodings. 	 -->
				</p> <br>
			</div>
			
			<div id="Interface">
				<h3> Final Visual Design </h3>
				  
				<p>DIVA (shown below) consists of three coordinated views to help with the drug safety tasks. <br><br>
		
				<strong>The Screening View (Left)</strong> gives an overview of all hypothesized drug-drug interactions supporting a user in screening unknown and
				high scored signals. Each node is a drug, and link depicts an interaction between the drugs. 
				<br><br>
				
				<strong>The Triage View (Middle) </strong> displays all the drug interactions associated with a particular
						drug (depicted as middle blue node). It helps users prioritize a drug for review based on its intearctions.
				<br><br>		
				<strong> The Forensics View (Right) </strong> uses a tree diagram that includes adverse reactions (third layer of nodes) related to each
						drug-drug interaction for further exploration. The purple color is used to highlight severe reactions.
				<!-- <br><br>
				To further investigate a drug interaction, at the detail level, a reports view visualizes the reports details associated
				with a selected drug interaction. -->
				</p>

				<figcaption class="alignCenterCaption">DIVA Interface. <strong>Left: </strong>Screening view to explore the DDI signals. <strong>Middle: </strong> Triage view to prioritize signals related to specific drugs.
					<strong>Right: </strong>Forensics view to get the adverse reaction details of a drug related signals.

		</div>
		<div id="CaseStudy">
				<h3 >DIVA Validation</h3>
				For evaluation, case studies followed by brief interviews were conducted with ten users at the FDA. <br><br>
				<p><strong>Case Study</strong></p>
				<p>
					This case study demonstrates the effectiveness of DIVA in interpretting and identifying interesting DDI signals generated by machine learning that need validation. <br><br>
					During exploration of DIVA, the user identifies Lansoprazole with a high scored (dark color) unknown interaction with Digoxin in the Screening view. The user investigates this DDI further in the Forensics view 
				    and notices a serious reaction (Acute Kidney Injury). 
					
					<br> <br> Upon reviewing the reports, the user discovers that other drugs taken by the patient in these reports might be the underlying
					reason for this severe reaction.</p>

		
		
				<img src="projects/divacase.png" alt="Project 1"/> <br><br> <br>

				<p><strong>Qualitative User Feedback</strong></p>
				<blockquote class="centerQuote"> "It is easy to differentiate DMEs from non-DMEs through the highlights, as compared
						to reading the list or trusting one's memory."</blockquote>
				<blockquote class="centerQuote">"Having the ability to
						highlight interesting and highly scored signals is very effective in
						narrowing down our investigation."</blockquote>
				<blockquote class="centerQuote">"This has not been
						done before, it is very useful and aligns with our workflow."</blockquote>

		</div>

		<h3 id="outcome">Takeaways</h3>
		<p>
				DIVA is a step towards making machine-learning adaptable to the novice users.
				There are many directions to explore this project further. For instance, to reduce the visual clutter in the Screening view, drug classes can be integrated to group signals associated with drugs in the same class. Also, domain knowlege such as including the symptoms for which drugs were taken can be helpful.
