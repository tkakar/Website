		<h3 id="Goal">Project Goal</h3>
		<p>
		To design a visual analytics system that aligns with the drug safety analysis workflow to support the detection, screening, and verification of
		machine-generated hypothesized drug interaction signals by providing interactive visualizations.  
		</p> <br>
		
		<h3 id="Background">Backgound & Motivation</h3>
		<p>
		Adverse reactions caused by drug-drug interactions (DDI) are a major public health concern. Currently, adverse reaction signals are
		detected through a tedious manual process in which drug safety evaluators review a large number of reports collected through
		post-marketing drug surveillance. On the other hand, applying machine learning techniques generate a large number of candidate signals that are disconnected
		from the underlying reports important for providing context, and ultimately require human intervention to be validated
		in the domain context as a true signal warranting action. Therefore, an interactive visual analytics system might be a possible solution to explore and analyze these signals.
		</p> <br>
		
		<h3 id="Task Analysis">User Research</h3>
		<p><strong>Users. </strong> Our users for DIVA are drug safety evaluators at the FDA who's responsibility is the detection of drug safety signals, that is, adverse reactions.</p>
		<p><strong>Task Analysis. </strong>I conducted semi-structured interviews and observed five users at the FDA to understand the drug safety workflow. </p>

		<h3 id="Design">Design Process and Challenges</h3>
		<p><strong>Data. </strong>A machine generated DDI signal is composed of a complex data model consisting of the interacting drugs, a set of adverse reactions, an interaction leading to multiple reaction sets, and a numeric score to quantify the significance of the signal. To make this data useful for the drug safety analysis
		integration of domain knowledge such as the severity of the reactions, the status of the signals being known or unknown, and interactive linking to the underlying reports is crucial. 
		</p>
		<p><strong>Tasks. </strong>Based on our user research, the system should support users in the screening and exploration of these machine generated signals, where they can interactively screen and prioritize important signals i.e., highly scored and unknown signals, and analyze them to see if further investigation is needed. </p>

		<p><strong>Visual Design and Alternatives.</strong>
		Given the complexity of the DDI signals and user tasks, designing a single visualization is not feasible. Therefore based on literature review and suitability of the visualization techniques for the underlying data, multiple visualizations are considered. To help users explore the 
		set of all the machine-generated drug-drug interactions (DDIs) the first suitable candidate is an Adjacency Matrix (below figures). 
		</p>

		<img src="projects/divamatrix.png" alt="Adjacency Matrix"/> <br><br>
		<p>
		Due to sparsity of the matrix for real data, next a node-link diagram is designed. In the node-link diagrams, the nodes are mapped to the drugs and the links depict the interaction between drugs. The visual encodings, i.e., color and size of 
		the links (Screening view) and nodes (Triage view) are mapped to the significance score of the signals and status of the reactions, respectively.
		The node-link design for all the views are iteratively refined to choose the most suitable visual encodings
		for mapping the underlying signals data. 
		
		<br><br><img src="projects/divanl.png" alt="Node-Link Diagrams"/> <br><br>
		
		To help analaysts prioritize drugs based on their signals, a node-link diagram based small-multiples layout (Signal Triage View) is designed to show the DDIs associated with a single drug. 
		Finally, to support the analysis of DDIs in detail by displaying their associated adverse reactions, a tree diagram (Signal Forensics View) is designed following similar visual encodings. 	
		</p> <br>
		
		<h3 id="Interface"> DIVA Interface </h3>
		  
		<p>The interface of DIVA (shown below) consists of three multiple coordinated
				views to help with the drug safety tasks. 
				The Screening view (left) gives an overview of all machine-generated drug-drug interactions supporting a user in screening unknown and
				high scored signals. The Triage view (middle), composed of small multiples, shows all the drug interactions associated with a particular
				drug or set of drugs. It helps users prioritize a drug for review
				based on the aggregated significance of its interactions and severity of reactions. The Forensics view (right) includes adverse reactions related to each
				drug-drug interaction for further exploration. To further
				investigate a drug interaction, at the detail level, a reports view
				visualizes the line-listings and text narratives of reports associated
				with a selected drug interaction.

		<p>DIVA Interface. <strong>Left: </strong>Screening view to explore the generated drug interaction signals. <strong>Middle: </strong> Triage view to prioritize signals related to specific drugs.
			<strong>Right: </strong>Forensics view to get the adverse reaction details of a drug related signals. 
		</p><br>
		
		
		<h3 id="CaseStudy">DIVA Validation</h3>
		<p>
			This case study conducted with a drug safety evaluator (user) at the FDA demonstrates the effectiveness of DIVA in vetting unknown DDI signals.
			During exploration of DIVA, the user quickly identifies Lansoprazole with a high scored (dark color) unknown interaction with Digoxin in the Screening view. The user investigates this DDI further in the Forensics view 
			to analyze the associated adverse reactions, and notices that it's a serious reaction (Acute Kidney Injury). The user is curious about this severe signal and interactively views the reports associated with this signal to validate if it is a potential safety issue. Upon reviewing the reports, she discovers that other drugs taken by the patient in these reports might be the underlying
			reason for this severe reaction.</p>

		<p>
			This demonstrates how DIVA can help users not only interpret but also easily identify interesting and complex DDI signals generated by machine learning that are mere hypotheses about potential drug safety issues that need validation.

		<h3>Future Research Direction</h3>
		<p> 
			Due to the visual clutter in the Screening View, in the future drug classes can be leveraged to cluster signals associated with drugs in the same class. This will help in comparing drugs within and across drug classes. 
		</p> <br>

		<h3>Project Contributions</h3>
		<p> 
			In this project, I conducted user research, defined project goals, designed visual mockups, developed low- and high-fidelity prototypes, and conducted case studies and interviews with domain experts to evaluate the prototypes.
