		<h3>Design Challenge - Overview and Goal</h3>
		<p>
			While annotations such as adding notes, bookmarks, and highlights are useful in reading books and many ebooks app provide these features. Not many audiobook players, with the exception of a few, allow users to annotate a book as they are listening. One such app <strong><a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/">Libby</a></strong> provides the features of annotations.
			<br> <br>The goal of this design is to improve Libby by making it highly interactive and personal audiobook mobile app that allows users to bookmark, highlight excerpts, and add annotations. 
		</p> <br>


		<h3>Opportunities for Design Improvement</h3>
		<p> I experienced Libby as a user and identified the following pros and cons related to adding annoations to a book. </p>

				<ul>						
					<li>Track breakdown by time segment.</li>
					<li>Visual feedback of annotations.</li>
					<li>Activity history with a summary of annotations.</li>
					<li>Color options for highlight.</li>
				</ul>

			<div>
				<p class="subheading">Design Opportunities</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Bookmark does not allow adding remarks.</li>
					<li>Unable to rename a bookmark.</li>
					<li>Highlighting is not intuitive (difficult to find how to highlight).</li>
					<li>Highlight is activated only when track is playing.</li>
					<li>Highlight is only added to the audio at the current player location and cannot not be added to an excerpt (audio segment).</li>
				</ul>

		<h3>Research of Other Audio and Ebook Apps</h3>
		<p>
		To have a better understanding of the required features, I explored a few apps.
		<ul>
			<li>Amazon Kindle and Apple Books app to see the interactive features of reading an eBook and how bookmarks, highlights, and notes are added in each of these apps.	</li>
			<li>Audible, Apple's Podcast and Books Apps, Pandora, and Soundcloud to take a closer look at audio players and their capabilities, features, and shortcomings.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Identified Features for a Good User Experience</h3>
		<p>
			Based on my research and brainstorming, below is the list of features that I prioritized to be included in our audiobook player app.
			<ul>
				<li>Highlight an audio by selecting excerpts.</li>
				<li>View text related to the highlight.</li>
				<li>Share highlighted text/audio with others.</li>
				<li>Add Bookmarks.</li>
				<li>Add Notes (both using text and by recording audio notes).</li>
				<li>View and Edit the Annotation (Activity) History.</li>
				<li>Search in the audiobook for a word.</li>
				<li>View summary of activity for each chapter in a book.</li>
				<li>Dashboard that allows user to set goals and monitor their reading routine.</li>
				<li>View summary of annotation activity for each book (currently reading) in the dashboard.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>Additional Features and Food for Thought</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Adding dictionary access in the app.</li>
			<li>Audio to text conversion for audio notes.</li>
			<li>Zoom in/out on the track player (to control track breakdown).</li>
			<li>Attention check points set by the user to help them stay focused while listening to a chapter.</li>
			<li>Combine audiobook and eBook in th app by playing the audio as well as displaying the text (controlled by users, whichever they prefer). </li>
		</ul>
