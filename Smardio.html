		<h3>Design Challenge - Probe</h3>
		<p>
			While annotations such as adding notes, bookmarks, and highlights are useful in reading books and many ebook apps provide these features. However, many audiobook apps don't provide these features. 
			<br> <br><strong>The goal of this</strong> challenge is to design a highly interactive and personal audiobook mobile app that allows annotations. 
		</p> 

		
		<div class="topMargin">	
			<h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
			<p>
			To have a better understanding of the required features, I explored a few apps.
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ebook Apps - </strong>Amazon Kindle,  Apple Books. </li>
					 <!-- and how bookmarks, highlights, and notes are added in each of these apps.	</li> -->
				<li><strong>Audtioplayer Apps - </strong>Audible, Apple's Podcast, Apple Books, Pandora, and Soundcloud.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Research and Design Inspiration</h3>
			<p><strong><a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/">Libby</a></strong> is one of the few audiobook player apps that support adding annotations to a book. 
			 I experienced Libby as a user and identified the following design opportunities for redesign. </p>

					<p class="subheading">Key Pluses of Libby</p>
					<ul>						
						<li>Track breakdown by time segment.</li>
						<li>Visual feedback of annotations.</li>
						<li>Activity history with a summary of annotations.</li>
						<li>Color options for highlight.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p class="subheading">Design Opportunities</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Bookmark does not allow adding remarks.</li>
							<li>Unable to rename a bookmark.</li>
							<li>Highlighting is not intuitive (difficult to find how to highlight).</li>
							<li>Highlight is activated only when track is playing.</li>
							<li>Highlight is added at a point current time and does not support excerpt selection.</li>

			<h3>Identified Features for a Good User Experience</h3>
			<p>
				<!-- Based on my research and brainstorming, below is the list of features that I prioritized to be included in our audiobook player app. -->
				<ul>
					<!-- <li>Highlight an audio by selecting excerpts.</li> -->
					
					<!-- <li>Share highlighted text/audio with others.</li> -->
					<li>Add bookmarks, highlights, and notes.</li>
					<li>View text related to the highlight.</li>
					<li>Add Notes (both using text and by recording audio notes).</li>
					<li>View and Edit the Annotation (Activity) History.</li>
					<li>Search in the audiobook for a word.</li>
					<!-- <li>View summary of activity for each chapter in a book.</li> -->
					<li>Add a dashboard to let user set goals and monitor their reading routine.</li>
					<li>View summary of annotation activity for each book (currently reading).</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Takeaways</h3><p>This design challenge gave me the opportunity to help users:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Have a more seamless reading experience.</li>
					<li>Get more inclined to use audiobooks for their academic readings.</li>
					<li>Track their reading activity and monitor their goals.</li>
				</ul> 
		</div>

		<div class="topMargin">
			<h3>Next Steps</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Adding dictionary access in the app.</li>
				<li>Audio to text conversion for audio notes.</li>
				<li>Zoom in/out on the track player (to control track breakdown).</li>
				<li>Attention check points set by the user to help them stay focused while listening to a chapter.</li>
				<li>Combine both audiobook and eBook experience together and let user choose. </li>
			</ul>
