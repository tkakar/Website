		<h3>Project Goal</h3>
		<p>
		  To design a visual analytics tool that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
		  and interactive visualizations to support the exploration of semi-structured drug safety reports to help drug safety evaluators (users) in screening critical medication errors.
		</p>

		<h3>Backgound</h3>
		<p>
		  A medication error involves mistakes that are caused by wrong administration or handling of drug due to ambiguity of drug label or
		  carton. Every year, serious preventable medication errors occur in 3.8 million inpatient admissions and 3.3 million outpatient visits with an estimated annual cost burden
		  of <strong>$20 billion</strong>. FDA collects and analyzes semi-structured medication error reports to take appropriate regulatory actions to prevent these errors from happening in the future. 
		  <br>
		  Currently, FDA uses spreadsheets to analyze these reports which can be time-consuming and tedious. My goal is to design an interactive system that aids the screening and analysis of these reports.
		</p>
	    <br>
		
		<h3 id="Design">Design Process and Challenges</h3>
		<p><strong>Data. </strong> The medication error reports contain structured information about patients such as age and gender, and medication errors such as types of errors, stages where
		error has occurred, the names of the medications, and the causes of the errors. Majority of the information about is present in the text narratives. We extract
		this information using NLP and domain dictionaries. The challenge with these text entities is that they are high-cardinality categorical attributes. For instance, hundreds of drugs can be reported
		in a week. Therefore, a visual design that can display a large number of attribute categories in a compact display with minimal visual clutter is needed.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Task. </strong>
		The drug safety evaluators at the FDA receive hundreds of these reports on a weekly basis. As a first task, they aim to see an overall summary of the
		their weekly reports and then filter and analyze reports based on critical attribute values to decide whether an action needs to be taken to mitigate the error. 
		</p>

		<p><strong>Design Considerations. </strong>
		To design an interactive overview of the reports set, I considered multiple visual designs based on literature review.
		The candidate visualizations to represent these categorical attributes included a multi-layer radial chart, bar-charts, parallel coordinates, node-link diagrams, and treemap visualization aa depicted in the following medium-fidelity prototypes.
		In these designs, the severity of the reports (outcome) for each attribute value is mapped to the color, and the size of the bar or chunk is mapped to the count of the reports. 
		Based on discussions with users, the treemap visualization (right) is selected as the final design. However, with real data the color hue created different shades, therefore, color saturation 
		is used in the final prototype.

		<h3 id="Interface"> MEV Interface </h3>
		  
		<p> The interface of MEV (shown below) consists of three multiple coordinated
			views to help with the medication error reports screening. 
			The top panel displays the structured information such as demographics of the patients. The middle panel represents a 
			treemap visualization for each of the high-categorical categorical attributes extracted via NLP. The bottom panel represents a summary of the 
			reports count per day. Interactive brushing and linking is provided to select and analyze report with particular attribute values. 
		</p>

		<h3 id="CaseStudy">User Study</h3>
		<p>
			I designed and conducted a within subject task-based usability study with 10 drug safety evaluators at the FDA, where each participant performed the tasks using MEV and their current tools (spreadsheets). The low-level tasks such as information search and extraction involved in the screening of the medication errors were identified via analyst's observation during contextual inquiries. Participants were asked to complete a system usability questionnaire at the end. </p>
		</p>

			<figcaption> <strong>Left</strong> - System Usability Score (SUS) for MEV was 85 out of 100. <strong>Right</strong> - Overall participants took less time to complete the tasks with MEV as compared to their current tools and perceived the tasks easier when performed with MEV.

		<h3>Project Participation</h3>
		<p> 
			In this project, I conducted the user research to understand user's tasks and pain points, defined project goals, designed visual mockups, developed low- to medium-fidelity prototypes, and led and mentored the engineering team (MQP) to develop a high-fidelity interactive prototype.
