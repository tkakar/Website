		<h3>What are Medication Errors?</h3>
		<p>
		  A medication error involves preventable mistakes that are caused by wrong administration or handling of drug due to ambiguity of drug label or
		  carton. 
		  <br><br>
		  Every year, serious preventable medication errors occur in 3.8 million inpatient admissions and 3.3 million outpatient visits with an estimated annual cost burden
		  of <strong>$20 billion</strong>. 
		  <br><br>

		  <h3>How are Medication Errors Detected?</h3>
		 <p>
		    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) analyzes semi-structured medication error reports collected via <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/surveillance/questions-and-answers-fdas-adverse-event-reporting-system-faers">adverse event reporting system</a> to take appropriate regulatory actions to prevent these errors from happening in the future.

		<h2  class="alignCenterCaption">Project Goal</h2>
		<p class="alignCenterCaption">
				To design a visual analytics tool that leverages interactive visualizations to support the exploration of semi-structured medication error reports to help drug safety evaluators in screening and prioritizing critical medication errors.  
		</p> <br>

		<div id="Research">
<!-- 
				We organized a series of one-on-one expert observations and semi-structured interview
				sessions with five. Our main goal was to gain an understanding
				of the current workflow of reviewing the stream of incoming error reports
				and in particular, to identify the challenges faced by the analysts while reviewing
				these reports.
				
				
				Our first session was to become familiar with the domain and included discussions
				about the overall medication error detection process, the reports and
				the challenges of analyzing these reports. As a second step, to get precise facts
				and figures, we designed a questionnaire that included detailed questions about
				the workflow based on the initial discussions. 
			
				Our second session with the same five drug safety analysts after few weeks
				involved field observation [26] followed by administering our carefully prepared
				questionnaire. We observed these analysts at the FDA in a think-aloud manner
				while performing their routine tasks of reports analysis.  -->
				
				<!-- This helped us derive
				information on their existing practices and tools used for reviewing reports.
				These interviews revealed that certain information was critical to the workflow
				and also helped us identify the limitations of their current tools. These insights
				then were instrumental in being able to derive use-cases and elicit detailed
				requirements related to the tasks that could potentially leverage visual analytics
				to make the review process efficient. -->

			<h3>User Research</h3>
			<p><strong>Users. </strong> Our users for MEV are drug safety evaluators at the Division of Medication Error
				Prevention and Analysis (DMEPA) at the FDA who are responsible for the detection of medication errors.</p> 
			
			<p><strong>Task Analysis. </strong>I conducted user interviews and observed five users at the FDA to understand how they analyze medication error reports. The interviews were guided by the following questions with the goal of understanding their tasks and analysis workflow. </p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>How many drugs a safety evaluator  gets assigned to?</li>
					<li>How many reports are received on a weekly basis?</li>
					<li>What is the most challenging aspect involved in the review of these reports?</li>
					<li>What steps they take to screen medication errors?</li>
					<li>What data elements are crucial for screening medication errors?</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Design Requirements</h3>
		<p> Based on my user research, the following features were identified as high priority for the visual analytics tool to help in screening critical medication errors.  
			<ul>
				<li>Providing an overview of the core data elements for data screening.</li>
				<li>Supporting the exploration of reports over time.</li>	
				<li>Facilitating the analysis of demographics.</li>
				<li>Allowing the analysts to quickly see the related atttributes of a selected data point.</li>
				<li>Facilitating identification of critical reports. </li>
				<li>Providing access to the actual reports associated with the selection.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3 id="Design">Design Process and Challenges</h3>
		<p><strong>Data. </strong> The medication error reports contain structured information about patients such as age and gender, and medication errors such as types of errors, stages where
		error has occurred, the names of the medications, and the causes of the errors. 
		<br><br>
		Majority of the information about is present in the text narratives. We extract
		this information using NLP and domain dictionaries. 
		
		<br><br>
		The challenge with these text entities is that they are high-cardinality categorical attributes. For instance, hundreds of drugs can be reported
		in a week. Therefore, a visual design is needed that can display a large number of attribute categories in a compact display with minimal visual clutter.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Task. </strong>
		The drug safety evaluators at the FDA receive hundreds of these reports on a weekly basis. As a first task, they aim to see an overall summary of the
		their weekly reports and then filter and analyze reports based on critical attribute values to decide whether an action needs to be taken to mitigate the error. 
		</p>

		</figure> -->

		<p><strong>Design Considerations. </strong>
		To design an interactive overview of the reports set, I considered multiple visual designs based on literature review.
		<br><br>
		The candidate visualizations to represent these categorical attributes included a multi-layer radial chart, bar-charts, parallel coordinates, node-link diagrams, and treemap visualization aa depicted in the following medium-fidelity prototypes.
		<br><br>
		In these designs, the severity of the reports (outcome) for each attribute value is mapped to the color, and the size of the bar or chunk is mapped to the count of the reports. 
		<br><br>
		Based on analyzing the pros and cons of each design, and discussions with users, the treemap visualization (right) is selected as the final design. However, with real data the color hue created different shades, therefore, color saturation 
		is used in the final prototype. 
		</p>

		<h3 id="Interface"> MEV Interface - Final Design </h3>
		  
		<p> The interface of MEV (shown below) consists of three multiple coordinated
			views to help with the medication error reports screening. 
			<br><br>
			The top panel displays the structured information such as demographics of the patients. 
			
			<br><br>The middle panel represents a 
			treemap visualization for each of the high-cardinality categorical attributes extracted via NLP.
			<br><br>
			 The bottom panel represents the temporal summary of the reports, that is,
			reports count per day. Interactive brushing and linking is provided to select and analyze report with particular attribute values. The color encodes the severity of the reports.

		<h3 id="CaseStudy">Uability Study</h3>
		<p> 
			I designed and conducted a within subject task-based usability study, where each participant performed the tasks using MEV and their current tools (spreadsheets). Participants also completed a system usability questionnaire at the end. </p>
		</p>
		<p> 
			<strong>Participants. </strong>I recruited 10 drug safety evaluators at the FDA via email and conducted the study in-person.		  
		</p>
		<p><strong>Study Tasks. </strong> The following low-level tasks such as information search and extraction involved in the screening of the medication errors were identified via literature review and analyst's observation during contextual inquiries.</p>	
			<ul style="list-style:none;">
				<li><strong>T1. </strong>How many total reports have been reported during a time period?</li>
				<li><strong>T2. </strong>Which medication error is reported the most for a time period?</li>
				<li><strong>T3. </strong>Which drug has most severe outcomes for a selected medication error?</li>
				<li><strong>T4. </strong>Which gender and age have most severe outcomes?</li>
				<li><strong>T5. </strong>Which age group is most prevalent in reports related to a selected product?</li>
				<li><strong>T6. </strong>What are the two most frequent medication errors reported with a select product, age group, and
					gender?</li>
				<li><strong>T7. </strong>Given the report distribution of a drug for female patients with a specified age group, what are
					the critical medication errors that need to be analyzed?</li>
				<li><strong>T8. </strong>What are the two most frequent root causes of error for a selected drug and medication error?</li>
				<li><strong>T9. </strong>What are the two most common reported stages of errors for a drug and a medication error?</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>Evaluation Metrics</h3>
		<p>The evaluation metrics included system usability as well as the <strong>time</strong> taken to complete a task and the <strong>perceived ease</strong> on a 5-point Likert
		scale (5 extremely easy and 1 extremely difficult) for completing each task. 
		</p>

		<figure>

			<figcaption> <strong>Left</strong> - System Usability Score (SUS) questionnaire. The total SUS (score) for MEV was 85 out of 100. <br> <strong>Right</strong> - Results of the tasks-based study. Overall participants took less time to complete the tasks with MEV as compared to their current tools (control) and perceived the tasks to be easier when performed with MEV. T8 & T9 were not supported by the current tools.

		<h3>Project Participation</h3>
		<p> 
			In this project, I worked with FDA stakeholders, domain experts from the DMEPA team at the FDA, researchers, data scientists, and developers. I conducted the user research to understand user's tasks and pain points, defined project goals, designed visual mockups, developed low- to medium-fidelity prototypes, and led and mentored the engineering team (MQP) to develop a web-based interactive visual analytics system.
