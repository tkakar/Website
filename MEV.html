		<h3>Backgound & Motivation</h3>
		<p>
		  A medication error involves mistakes that are caused by wrong administration or handling of drug due to ambiguity of drug label or
		  carton. Every year, serious preventable medication errors occur in 3.8 million inpatient admissions and 3.3 million outpatient visits with an estimated annual cost burden
		  of $20 billion. FDA collects and analyzes medication error reports to take appropriate regulatory actions to prevent these errors from happening in the future to avoid further damage. 
		  However, analysis of these semi-structured reports is a time-consuming and tedious process.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Medication Error Visualization (MEV) is an anlytics tools that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
		  and interactive visuals to display semi-structured reports to help FDA analysts in the screening of critical medication errors.
		</p> <br>
		
		<h3 id="Design">Design Process and Challenges</h3>
		<p><strong>Data. </strong> The medication error reports contain structured information about patients such as age and gender, and medication errors such as types of errors, stages where
		error has occurred, the names of the medications and the causes of the errors. Majority of the information about the errors such as stage, type and cause are present in the text narratives. We extract
		this information using NLP and domain dictionaries. The challenge with these text entities is that they are high-dimensional categorical attributes. For instance, hundreds of drugs can be reported
		in a week. Therefore, a visual design that can display a large number of attribute categories in a compact display with minimal visual clutter is needed.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Task. </strong>
		The drug safety analysts at the FDA receive hundreds of medication error reports on a weekly basis. As a first task, they aim to see an overall summary of the
		their weekly reports and then being able to interactively filter and analyze reports based on critical attribute values to decide whether an action needs to be taken to mitigate the error. 
		</p>
		<p><strong>Design Considerations. </strong>
		To design an interactive overview of the reports set, I considered multiple visual designs based on literature review.
		The candidate visualizations to represent these categorical attributes included a multi-layer radial chart, bar-charts, parallel coordinates, node-link diagrams, and treemap visualization aa depicted in the following medium-fidelity prototypes.
		In these designs, the severity of the reports (outcome) for each attribute value is mapped to the color, and the size of the bar or chunk is mapped to the count of the reports. 
		Based on discussions with users, the treemap visualization (right) is selected as the final design. However, with real data the color hue created different shades, therefore, color saturation 
		is used in the final prototype.

		<h3 id="Interface"> MEV Interface </h3>
		  
		<p>The interface of MEV (shown below) consists of three multiple coordinated
			views to help with the medication error reports screening. 
			The top panel displays the structured information such as demographics of the patients. The middle panel represents a 
			treemap visualization for each of the high-dimensional categorical attributes extracted via NLP. The bottom panel represents a summary of the 
			reports count per day. Interactive brushing and linking is provided to select and analyze report with particular attribute values. 
		</p>

		</p>
		<h3 id="CaseStudy">User Study</h3>
		<p>
			I designed and conducted a task-based user study with 10 drug safety analysts at the FDA, with low-level tasks involved in the screening of the medication errors.</p>
			Overall participants took less time to complete the tasks with MEV as compared to their current tools and perceived the tasks easier when performed with MEV. Moreover, the SUS score for MEV was 85 out of 100.

		<h3>Project Participation</h3>
		<p> 
			In this project, I conducted user research, defined project goals, designed visual mockups, developed low- to medium-fidelity prototypes, and led and mentored the undergraduate team (MQP) to develop a high-fidelity interactive prototype.
