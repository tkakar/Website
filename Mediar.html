		<h3>What are Drug-Drug Interaction related Adverse Reactions (DIARs)?</h3>
		<p>
		Multiple drugs taken simultaneously to
		treat medical conditions can lead to adverse drug reactions due to drug-drug
		interactions. For example, Aspirin taken together with
		Warfarin may lead to excessive bleeding
		<br><br>
		It is critical that such drug-drug interaction related adverse reactions (DIARs) are detected early with minimum patient
        exposure to avoid further harmful incidents.
		  
		 <br> <br> Unfortunately, identifying all DIARs in clinical trails is prohibitively expensive and impossible in practice - as it would require exhaustive
		  testing of every possible drug combination on human subjects.
		  
		  <br><br>

		  <h3>How are DIARs Detected?</h3>
		  <p>
		  For early detection of DIARs not captured during clinical trials, Spontaneous Reporting Systems have been
		  adopted worldwide to collect information on adverse events related to drugs reported by patients,
		  health care professionals and drug manufacturers. The massive
		  databases collected by these surveillance programs represent a valuable resource to tap into for DIAR discovery.
		  </p> <br>

		<h3>DIARs Generated by Machine Learning</h3>
		
			<p>  Machine-learning techniques such as association rule mining has recently been developed to extract potential DIAR signals from the adverse event reports with a score depicting their significance.

				Following is example of a set of signals generated by machine learning.

		<p class="alignCenterCaption">
				To design a visual analytics tool that leverages interactive visualizations to support the exploration of semi-structured medication error reports to help drug safety evaluators in screening and prioritizing critical medication errors.  
		</p> <br>

		<div id="Research">

			<h3>User Research</h3>
			<p><strong>Users. </strong> Our users for MEV are drug safety evaluators at the Division of Medication Error
				Prevention and Analysis (DMEPA) at the FDA who are responsible for the detection of medication errors.</p> 
			
			<p><strong>Task Analysis. </strong>I conducted user interviews and observed five users at the FDA to understand how they analyze medication error reports. The interviews were guided by the following questions with the goal of understanding their tasks and analysis workflow. </p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>How many drugs a safety evaluator  gets assigned to?</li>
					<li>How many reports are received on a weekly basis?</li>
					<li>What is the most challenging aspect involved in the review of these reports?</li>
					<li>What steps they take to screen medication errors?</li>
					<li>What data elements are crucial for screening medication errors?</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Design Requirements</h3>
		<p> Based on my user research, the following features were identified as high priority for the visual analytics tool to help in screening critical medication errors.  
			<ul>
				<li>Providing an overview of the core data elements for data screening.</li>
				<li>Supporting the exploration of reports over time.</li>	
				<li>Facilitating the analysis of demographics.</li>
				<li>Allowing the analysts to quickly see the related atttributes of a selected data point.</li>
				<li>Facilitating identification of critical reports. </li>
				<li>Providing access to the actual reports associated with the selection.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3 id="Design">Design Process and Challenges</h3>
		<p><strong>Data. </strong> The medication error reports contain structured information about patients such as age and gender, and medication errors such as types of errors, stages where
		error has occurred, the names of the medications, and the causes of the errors. 
		<br><br>
		Majority of the information about is present in the text narratives. We extract
		this information using NLP and domain dictionaries. 
		
		<br><br>
		The challenge with these text entities is that they are high-cardinality categorical attributes. For instance, hundreds of drugs can be reported
		in a week. Therefore, a visual design is needed that can display a large number of attribute categories in a compact display with minimal visual clutter.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Task. </strong>
		The drug safety evaluators at the FDA receive hundreds of these reports on a weekly basis. As a first task, they aim to see an overall summary of the
		their weekly reports and then filter and analyze reports based on critical attribute values to decide whether an action needs to be taken to mitigate the error. 
		</p>


		<p><strong>Design Considerations. </strong>
		To design an interactive overview of the reports set, I considered multiple visual designs based on literature review.
		<br><br>
		The candidate visualizations to represent these categorical attributes included a multi-layer radial chart, bar-charts, parallel coordinates, node-link diagrams, and treemap visualization aa depicted in the following medium-fidelity prototypes.
		<br><br>
		In these designs, the severity of the reports (outcome) for each attribute value is mapped to the color, and the size of the bar or chunk is mapped to the count of the reports. 
		<br><br>
		Based on analyzing the pros and cons of each design, and discussions with users, the treemap visualization (right) is selected as the final design. However, with real data the color hue created different shades, therefore, color saturation 
		is used in the final prototype.

		<h3 id="Interface"> MEV Interface - Final Design </h3>
		  
		<p> The interface of MEV (shown below) consists of three multiple coordinated
			views to help with the medication error reports screening. 
			<br><br>
			The top panel displays the structured information such as demographics of the patients. 
			
			<br><br>The middle panel represents a 
			treemap visualization for each of the high-cardinality categorical attributes extracted via NLP.
			<br><br>
			 The bottom panel represents the temporal summary of the reports, that is,
			reports count per day. Interactive brushing and linking is provided to select and analyze report with particular attribute values. The color encodes the severity of the reports.

		<h3>Project Participation</h3>
		<p> 
			In this project, I worked with FDA stakeholders, domain experts from the DMEPA team at the FDA, researchers, data scientists, and developers. I conducted the user research to understand user's tasks and pain points, defined project goals, designed visual mockups, developed low- to medium-fidelity prototypes, and led and mentored the engineering team (MQP) to develop a web-based interactive visual analytics system.
